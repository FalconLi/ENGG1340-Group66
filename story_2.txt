The Haking Wonderland 

Once upon a time, in a world of magic and technology, there lived a young man named FanFan.
From a young age, he had been fascinated by the power of computer science and longed to study at the esteemed HKU.

After years of hard work and dedication, FanFan has already been accepted into HKU and was only one step away from achieving his dream.
He had been tasked with passing the six secret trials of the Haking Wonderland, a mysterious and fantastical place where dreams and reality collided.

With a heart full of determination and a mind sharpened by years of study,
FanFan stepped into the Haking Wonderland, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. 
But as soon as he crossed the threshold, the world around him began to spin, and the ground shook beneath his feet.

Opening his eyes, FanFan found himself sitting right in front of "THIS" computer, 
while his spirit pulled into a magical illusion, drifting out from the elevator of the 3rd floor of the Haking Wonderland.

The six trials lay ahead, waiting for FanFan to challenge. 
Whether he can step through the arduous and perilous road to achieve his dreams, let's see!
